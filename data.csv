After gesturing that he could not hear, the driver was astounded when the officer repeated the charge - in sign language - and presented him with a speeding ticket.

That the policeman could communicate this way is not regarded as unusual by residents of this small Connecticut town near the Massachusetts border. The Chief of Police and other officers have studied sign language at the community college, as have several merchants, teachers, waitresses, bank tellers and hospital employees. 

The community's continuing interest in the education of the deaf has helped support a post-secondary school program being offered at the college.

8/9/1981,Sound; PERIL: SONIC EXCESS,"  As any Puritan knows, danger lurks in our pleasures, and the trouble is that sometimes the dangers are real. After this column reported on the current popularity of lightweight earphones (June 21), we received a cautionary letter from Dr. Jane Reger Madell, warning of possible injury to the ear. The risk, Dr. Madell points out, does not lie in the use of earphones as such, but rather in listening at excessive loudness levels. Too often, it seems, earphones tempt their users to sonic excess.   Dr. Madell has done some field work on this. As a member of an institution serving people with hearing impairments, she grew concerned about the sudden proliferation of earphones used with portable sound equipment as more and more people in this city and others go about their business in a state of sonic immersion.  Equipped with a precisely calibrated sound-level meter, she stopped wired-for-sound pedestrians on the streets, asking if she might measure the loudness level of their earphones. As it turned out, a lot of ambulatory music is played at loudness levels upward of 100 decibels (db) with some as high as 120 db, which is close to the sound level of unmuffled jackhammers heard from across a street.",article,News,Arts and Leisure Desk,Arts

The case is an appeal by a northern Westchester school district from a Federal appeals court decision requiring it to provide a signlanguage interpreter for a deaf third grader. The appeals court based its ruling on the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which gives handicapped children the right to a ''free appropriate public education'' and requires school districts to prepare an ''individualized education program'' to accomplish that goal for every handicapped child.

The Home for the Aged Blind was founded in the 1920's by the Jewish Guild for the Blind as a residence for blind children. As the services of the guild expanded to include social and vocational guidance, its philosophy evolved and by the late 1920's it was believed that a child's needs were best served in a home, rather than in an institutional setting.

Martin Adler, the director of an institution that he describes as ''the only national center for rehabilitation of the deaf-blind,'' said the proposal called for slashing $1.4 million from its current allocation of $3.2 million. This would mean, he said, that there would be hardly enough left to pay for salaries in a situation where the ratio of staff to clients, one-to-one plus support aides, is necessarily so high.

In an interview with Mr. Adler and Robert Smithdas, the center's deaf-blind director of community education, the director saw a glimmer of hope in a bill before Congress that would exempt the center from the across-the-board cuts in discretionary funds that most services to the handicapped are expected to suffer.

Educators across the nation are looking to the case for a definition of what Congress meant in 1975 when it passed a law requiring all school districts to provide a ''free appropriate public education'' to handicapped children.   Does an ''appropriate'' education mean one that enables a child to become, as a Federal District Court posed the issue, ''a functioning member of society''? Or does it mean giving a handicapped child such as Amy, who had been performing in the top half of her class when her parents requested an interpreter, what the court called ''an opportunity to achieve his full potential''?   The case comes when educators throughout the nation are grappling with the practical implications of the law, the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which called for sweeping changes in the instruction of handicapped children, who have been long neglected by school systems.",article,News,Science Desk,Science

5/23/1982,CASEWORKER TO HISTORY'S VICTIMS,"  When Susan Thames Pettiss was in the fifth grade in Mobile, Ala., she was asked what she would like to be when she grew up. ''My mother wasn't a circus acrobat or President of the country, so I said I would like to be a plain lady like she was,'' she recalled the other day.   Dr. Pettiss, who retired this month as director of blindness prevention for Helen Keller International because she will soon be 70, turned out in fact to be anything but ''a plain lady.'' Participant in History   Rather, she became a witness and often a direct participant in several major historical events of the last four decades. She was in Europe when World War II ended and helped countless refugees build new lives. She was in South Vietnam to plan for reconstruction of essential services ''after we had won the war,'' she said, when the Tet offensive was started by the other side. She was a student at an American university when the protests of the late 1960's erupted, and she marched in opposition to the war. She was in Afghanistan, helping establish a program to prevent blindness in children, when Soviet troops invaded.",article,News,Style Desk,Style
6/5/1982,MRS. REAGAN VISITS BLIND YOUTHS IN PARIS,"  Nancy Reagan visited the National Institute for Blind Youth today and, as usual when on public display, she looked happier and considerably more relaxed with the children than she does with adults.   From the moment she walked in the door, where she was greeted by Monique Petit, the director of the institute, she unbent from the protocol formality observed on most occasions. She took the hand of Patrick Lucas, an 11-year-old blind student who accompanied her throughout the visit, patted his arm as he stood beside her while she received a briefing on the school, and generally looked at ease.   When she was told that Patrick had something of a reputation as a singer, she said, ''Later on we'll get in a corner and he'll sing.  Right, Patrick?'' Patrick looked doubtful. Mrs. Reagan continued, ''You sing and I'll hum, just you and me alone.'' Patrick, who has an English mother and French father and speaks English, grinned, shook his head and said, ''No.'' Whenever Patrick fell behind during the tour, Mrs. Reagan would look back, take his hand, or call, ''Patrick, Patrick.''",article,News,Style Desk,Style

6/29/1982,EXCERPTS FROM JUSTICES' OPINION IN CASE OF A DEAF GIRL AND SCHOOL DISTRICT,"  Following are excerpts from today's Supreme Court ruling that Federal law does not require schools to provide sign-language interpreters for deaf children. The majority opinion was written by Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist, and the dissenting opinion by Associate Justice Byron R. White. For the Majority Justice Rehnquist   This case presents a question of statutory interpretation.  Petitioners contend that the Court of Appeals and the District Court misconstrued the requirements imposed by Congress upon states which receive Federal funds under the Education for All Handicapped Children Act. We agree and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.   The Education for All Handicapped Children Act of 1975 provides Federal money to assist state and local agencies in educating handicapped children, and conditions such funding upon a state's compliance with extensive goals and procedures.",article,Text,Metropolitan Desk,New York
6/29/1982,EFFECT OF HANDICAPPED RULING UNCLEAR,"  The Supreme Court's decision yesterday that a Peekskill, N.Y., school district does not have to provide a sign-language interpreter to a deaf fourth grader was greeted yesterday with expressions of relief from school boards across the country and with disappointment by groups representing the deaf and other handicapped youngsters.   The decision marks the first time the nation's highest court has ruled on a law, passed by Congress in 1975, that requires all school districts to provide a ''free appropriate public education'' to handicapped children.   As lawyers reviewed the decision late yesterday, it remained unclear what its impact would be on the 4.4 million handicapped children across the country who are now in special education programs. Learning Could Be Impeded   For 10-year-old Amy Rowley of Peekskill, however, the immediate impact of the decision will be that she will lose her personal signlanguage interpreter, a loss that Nancy Rowley, Amy's mother, said could impede her daughter's ability to learn.",article,News,Metropolitan Desk,New York
6/29/1982,SCHOOLS BACKED ON LIMITING AID TO HANDICAPPED,"  The Supreme Court ruled today that Federal law entitles handicapped children to a public education from which they can derive ''some educational benefit.'' But the Court said that local school districts are not obliged to provide services that such children need to reach their full academic potential.   In a 6-to-3 decision, the Court overturned rulings by two Federal courts in New York that had ordered a Westchester County school district to provide a sign-language interpreter for a deaf fourth grader.   The lower courts interpreted a Federal law, the Education for All Handi- Excerpts from opinions, page B4. capped Children Act of 1975, to require local schools to give each handicapped child ''an opportunity to achieve his full potential.'' Under that standard, the lower courts said, the Hendrick Hudson Central School District had to provide the fourth grader, Amy Rowley, with a sign-language interpreter in the classroom.",article,News,Metropolitan Desk,New York

In this, its 75th year, it has been deluged with letters, not about the quality of its articles or the slant of its editorial policy, just long chatty letters about how things are getting on back home.   Most of them are from people who have read The Ziegler for years, and for whom it was, initially, something more than a magazine.

WHITE PLAINS","IT first appears to be an ordinary swimming class. Two instructors in sleek tank suits are putting their students through the paces, showing them the proper way to crook an arm, the efficient means of treading water. There are exclamations of sudden understanding, a few frustrated laughs when a point is not well taken.

On closer examination, however, it becomes apparent that this is not just any lesson. Before they enter the pool, the pupils are guided around its decks, and are told what material the lane dividers are made of so that they might recognize them by touch. When they do submerge, they are oriented as to their positions in the water.

This is a class for the blind and visually impaired. Available free of charge, it is held Thursday evenings through Aug. 19 at the White Plains Y.M.C.A., and is sponsored by the Y and the Westchester Lighthouse for the Blind.

The principle and its corollaries are likely to be influential far beyond the world of the handicapped.   We Americans don't like the concept of rationing. That fact probably explains why we have tried to avoid the basic problem opened up by the vast expansion of Government-financed social services begun in the Johnson Administration and continually expanded until these still-young parsimonious 1980's.",article,Op-Ed,Editorial Desk,Opinion

He is kept in seclusion by his mother, who fears that if he sees a knight, he will be tempted to become one and will eventually die in combat. One day, however, some knights pass through the forest, and Parzival is indeed enthralled. He follows them and eventually becomes a knight, but he must face many severe tests - encounters with beasts, knights and women - before he becomes a truly strong man.   This weekend, at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn, the story of Parzival, based on the work by Wolfram von Eschenbach, will be performed by the National Theater of the Deaf.

Sometimes it takes years of traumatic exposure to high sound levels before any symptoms become manifest. Yet the vogue for portable sound equipment - such as Walkman-type radios and tape players - has already produced an alarming increase of clinically verified hearing damage, especially among rock addicts who like their music loud.   On the whole, the audio industry has reacted to what has become a public health problem in the same way the automobile industry reacts to traffic casualties. The trouble, the industry claims, lies not with the product but with its improper use.

8/20/1984,DEWHURST ADAPTS TO LANGUAGE OF DEAF THEATER,"   On a hot summer afternoon in a converted old mill above a Connecticut brook, a group of actors is gathered in a room that is strangely still. The makeshift stage is full of characters in motion, but only one voice is speaking, that of a curly haired young man watching the others from a corner. Otherwise there is silence, save for the noisy splashing of the brook and the droning of a fly.    Following the action intently is Colleen Dewhurst, the actress. At the moment, her role is that of director, and when the actors have run through their scenes, they will gather around for her to give them notes on their work. However, in this case her comments will be delivered in sign language by the interpreter sitting at her side.

Through the Infrared Listening System, installed over the last five years in 24 theaters and concert halls in New York City, those with hearing disabilities can tune in to every word as it is spoken.    In fact, they can hear so clearly in theaters that are equipped with the sound system that occasionally their companions - with no hearing impairment - have been overheard asking    them    what was said on stage. As one serendipitous result, the lightweight headsets are sometimes rented by those with normal hearing.

10/9/1985,PERSONAL HEALTH,"  IF a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make any noise? The answer to this perennial puzzle is yes. Sound is generated when molecules of air are displaced, setting up a gradually widening series of ripples that resembles a wedge cut from the ripples on a lake after a fish jumps.   But while sound does not depend upon someone hearing it, people depend on hearing sound as an aid to survival: the honk of a horn, the ring a telephone or doorbell, the buzz of an alarm, not to mention the voices of other people, both live and electronically transmitted.   Thanks to modern technology, most of the nation's 17 million hearing-impaired individuals can now be helped to hear better through a variety of sophisticated devices, ranging from hearing aids custom-designed to the person's particular hearing problem to a still-experimental implant that can take over for the damaged cells that cause most cases of so-called nerve deafness.

But help is finally on the way. Doubleday recently started a Large Print Home Library, offering the visually disabled a broad range of hardcover novels, mysteries, romances and how-to titles.

But NBC and the ''Cosby'' producers are engaged in a dispute over who should pay the weekly tab -$1,250 - for captioning the hit series for deaf viewers.

It relies heavily on contextual guessing, which in turn requires a good repertory of English structures.''   The great majority of the hearing cannot sign. All, however, can with a little acquaintance and practice read lips. It is true that very few of the profoundly deaf ever learn to speak well, but their lip movements grant visual access to those who make even the slightest effort to communicate with them. Those who are deaf and have been taught lip-reading have little fear of approaching anyone who has the patience to understand what they are saying. Further, it has been my experience that syntax is no problem: the deaf read and write as well as those who hear; they fully enjoy subtitled films and television programs that are captioned. Lip-reading ''socializes'' them.",article,Letter,Book Review Desk,Books

11/19/1986,PERSONAL HEALTH,"  A TRAGEDY of modern medical care is that, even in an age of virtually instant communication, it often takes years to get the word out about new life- and limb-saving treatments to the people who could most benefit from them. One of these is laser therapy for an insidious disorder called diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of new cases of blindness among American adults. Some 600,000 people already have early stages of this condition and could lose their sight if it is not detected and promptly treated.   Each year, diabetic retinopathy renders some 5,000 diabetics legally blind, at least half of them unnecessarily. When the disorder is diagnosed early and treated with laser therapy, useful vision can often be preserved.   Yet a study in Wisconsin two years ago found that 62 percent of diabetics never had the eye examination necessary to detect retinopathy. In 1979, two years after the benefits of laser therapy were clearly demonstrated in a well-publicized national study, two-thirds of family physicians and half of internists surveyed in Michigan were unaware of the study and its implications for the prevention of blindness in diabetics.",article,Series,Living Desk,Home & Garden

Alexandra, who is hearing impaired and lip-reads with the assistance of hearing aids, was meeting one recent morning with a group of students at the New York School for the Deaf, in White Plains.

The meeting was in preparation for the students' trip to see a school performance of the ballet, which is being presented by the Westchester County Historical Society at the Academic Arts Theater of Westchester Community College from Tuesday through Thursday, with two public performances on Saturday.

11/11/1990,Computer Aids for Visually Impaired,"A TECHNOLOGY center has opened at the Westchester Lighthouse in White Plains. The center, one of eight in the state, features adaptive equipment that makes computers accessible to the blind or visually impaired.

Clients, who range in age from college students to the elderly, are evaluated at the center by George Ashiotis, the instructor. Mr. Ashiotis, who is legally blind, helps determine what equipment is needed and orders it. He then trains the client, who may take the equipment to his or her home or office after the lessons. Financing is from the State Commission for the Blind, and a grant from the State Legislature.

The technology ""falls into three main categories,"" Mr. Ashiotis explained: screen enlargement, synthetic speech and Braille output. Some people use one kind only, others find a combination more helpful.
The New Technology 

 In screen enlargement, letters may appear ""many times their normal size,"" Mr. Ashiotis said. Additionally, certain devices enable conversion from white print on a black screen to black print on a white screen, easier to read for the visually impaired. Others enable the user to read very large print one line at a time.

Speech synthesizers ""interpret software"" and, instead of converting it to print, synthesize it into spoken words that come through a headset. Quality ranges from ""stilted to almost human,"" depending on price, Mr. Ashiotis said.

In Braille output, a printer produces Braille characters either on a strip of paper.
Who Has Been Helped 

 Clients so far have included a woman in her 30's who is now able to be a ""vital force"" in her husband's landscaping business, working in billing and bookkeeping, Mr. Ashiotis reported; a 78-year-old woman who is losing her sight but who is now able to complete a book on the restoration of old buildings; and an accounting supervisor in a large corporation who is working with complex accounting systems.

The center, Mr. Ashiotis said, helps blind and visually impaired people lead productive, rewarding professional lives. ""It helps them not only to get jobs but, in the case of someone who is losing their vision, to keep the jobs they have."" 

Judith Millman, assistant director of the Westchester Lighthouse, added: ""This broadens the scope of our services. We feel it is vitally important to give people the tools they need to be competitive in the labor market.""",article,News,Westchester Weekly Desk,New York

It is no surprise to me to read of the tremendous interest hearing young people have in learning sign language. Six years ago, at the request of the children's librarian at the Mamaroneck Free Library, I began teaching a summer workshop in sign language for children ages 8 to 12 that has been repeated every summer since then. We require pre-registration and put a limit of 14 children on the class.   There are always many children on the waiting list and often adults want to join the class. Motivation is high, homework considerable as I give the children many pages of pictured signs each week, together with directions as to how to make the signs, and the origin of the signs. Children will take the pages home to share with parents, siblings, family and friends.   As a retired teacher of deaf children it gives me great pleasure to help bridge the gap between the deaf and the hearing in this manner and in this Westchester section of our world.

It has been my strong belief that blindness is a minor disability, and through the miracle of modern electronics, the playing field has become level. Of course, this lessening of distinction weakens the power base of militant organizations such as the National Federation of the Blind. Therefore their promotion of the sole use of Braille, which is an antiquated form of communication and which tends to insulate blind people rather than assimilate them into society.   It is paradoxical that the Disabilities Act, which was meant to equalize disabled persons with the rest of society, is now being used to vitiate its initial purpose by the reintroduction of Braille into curriculums. If in fact blind people do want to learn Braille, it should be an option. It is not their sole means to literacy. Through screen reading and computers, one can learn to spell; through word-processing programs, one can learn to write. I firmly believe that if comprehension through vision is the definition of a sighted person's literacy, then comprehension through sound is the visually disabled person's definition of literacy.",article,Letter,Editorial Desk,Opinion

2/18/1992,Deafness Gene,"  Scientists say they have identified a gene that can cause deafness in children, a step that may help in diagnosis and in finding a treatment.   Two independent teams of scientists have reported finding the gene that when defective causes a disorder called Waardenburg's syndrome.   The inherited syndrome is responsible for 3 percent of childhood deafness, said Dr. Aubrey Milunsky, an author of one of the reports. People with the syndrome often have a distinctive appearance that can include a shock of white hair, wide spacing of the eyes or one eye a different color from the other.   Only about 20 percent of patients have total hearing loss, Dr. Milunsky said. But anybody with the defective gene has a 50 percent chance of transmitting it to his or her child, in whom it may produce deafness, he said.   Dr. David Edelstein of the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, who was not connected with the study, said the finding might aid in diagnosis and point the way to a treatment.   The finding of the gene is reported in the current issue of the journal Nature. Researchers studied families with a history of the disease, and found that mutations in the gene were associated with appearance of the syndrome.   One team included Dr. Milunsky and colleagues at the Boston University School of Medicine and Elias da Silva at the Federal University of Puernambuco in Brazil. The other team included researchers in Britain and Germany.",article,News,Science Desk,Science

The subject, a 9-year-old boy named Simon, is uniquely appropriate for the experiment of asking whether language is learned or innate because he learned an error-riddled form of American Sign Language from his parents, who are also deaf, and a quite different sign language, with different grammatical rules, at his school.

5/27/1993,The Deaf Learn English and Pursue Careers; Deep-Rooted Distrust,"  To the Editor:   To understand the deaf community's anguish over the cochlear implant (front page, May 16), it is crucial to understand the history of repression of deaf culture. Otherwise, the opposition of many deaf people to an operation that can sometimes restore hearing seems, at best, odd or idiosyncratic. At worst, especially in the case of denying the operation to a child, it seems cruel.   In my research for a book on the history of the disability rights movement, I found that fear of the cochlear implant comes out of the deaf community's well-founded sense of oppression. It is a reaction to more than a century of belief that deafness is a sickness, to be pitied, cured and eradicated. Americans born deaf have their own language, a sign language with its own grammar and sentence structure that is quite different from English. Using it, they built a vibrant 19th-century culture.",article,Letter,Editorial Desk,Opinion

5/30/1993,Helping Children Live With Disabilities,"LAST October, for the first time in his life, Rhey Alcid walked. While a child's first steps are always exciting, Rhey's were especially so. He was 12 years old. To Rhey, who is physically and developmentally disabled, those first steps opened up a freedom he had never known. To those who helped him achieve that freedom, Rhey's steps were yet another sign of the progress that the Connecticut Institute for the Blind/Oak Hill in Hartford has made in its 100 years. 

The institute's name is somewhat of a misnomer, a vestige of the days when it was home to scores of blind children, most of whom entered as babies and either left as young adults or stayed on for life. Today the institute serves people with a wide range of disabilities including mental retardation and physical handicaps.",article,News,Connecticut Weekly Desk,New York

The Television Decoder Circuitry Act requires that every television set sold in the United States (except for old stock and small portable models) contain a built-in caption decoder. The object is to make television more accessible to the estimated 24 million Americans suffering from hearing loss.    In captioning, subtitles are transmitted along with the television signal for viewers unable to hear the audio portion of a broadcast. Until now, these subtitles could not be seen on regular television sets; a separate decoder costing from $130 to $180 was needed. But henceforth, decoders will be part of every set and can be activated at the touch of a button. Because the entire decoder can now be contained on a single microchip, it adds no more than $5 to $15 to the cost of the set.",article,News,Arts & Leisure Desk,Arts

Some of the test participants watched the movie through transparent plastic panels, with the captions reflected onto the panels from a moving-text display at the rear of the theater.

Dr. Golledge, a geographer at the university, was testing a prototype navigation system for the blind that announced the whereabouts of the objects through stereo headphones mounted to a computer in his backpack, creating a virtual reality landscape. The information came not from some miniature radar but from the signals broadcast by the military's network of global positioning satellites.

Guiding Eyes will send a representative to the home of anyone living too far to visit; the Seeing Eye often does, too.

A first-time guide-dog training at Seeing Eye takes 28 days; subsequent trainings take 21 days. The training at Guiding Eyes lasts 26 days for first-time and veteran dog users.   At the Seeing Eye, the cost of the dog, training, room, board and transportation to Morristown, N.J., from anywhere in the United States is $150. Training for subsequent dogs costs $50. Guiding Eyes charges nothing for its dogs and trainings, though students pay for their own transportation. If a student cannot afford the Seeing Eye's training or transportation to Guiding Eyes, the schools will cover the expenses. Each school will send out trainers if problems arise. Both are nonprofit agencies with endowments; the Seeing Eye's is $110 million, Guiding Eyes' $8 million.
