11/8/1915,"R.B. MANTELL POSES FOR FILM TRAGEDY; Noted Shakespearean Actor Seen in ""The Blindness of Devotion"" in Two Houses Here. 'MME. BUTTERFLY' PLEASES Mary Pickford a Winsome Cho Cho San ;- Marguerite Clark Well Cast in ""Still Waters.""","Robert B. Mantell, dean of American Shakespearean actors, made his début as a screen star yesterday simultaneously in the Riverside Theatre and the Academy of Music. The picture, which was from the studios of William Fox, was entitled ""The Blindness of Devotion."" If the title does not suggest the scenario, read this from the program:The story combines beauty, love, hatred, revenge, and action in a powerful and interesting manner. The plot deals with the marriage for money of Renee Delaveaux, an adventuress, to Count de Carney. The Count is the guardian of Pierre Cavereaux, a young soldier who, while visiting the Count, carries on a disgraceful intrigue with Renee. Another complication arises when Pierre, growing tired of Renee's fascinations, meets and loves Bella, the Count's beautiful niece. The Count discovers the liaison between Renee and Pierre but Bella, who is also aware of the affair, disarms suspicion by entering into a loveless marriage with Pierre. The sleeping demon in Renee's soul is aroused by this action and she attempts to poison the Count but fate rules against her, bringing this remarkable drama to a climax of overwhelming power and surprising realism.Undoubtedly Mr. Mantell is paid well for his services in his new field of endeavor, and he should be. For an actor who has devoted so many years to the classics, and who could probably recite from memory every line Shakespeare ever wrote in a play, to have to grimace through such a wordless drama must be something of a trial.John Luther Long's story, ""Madame Butterfly,"" after having been dramatized and made into an opera has finally reached the movies. A picture version was shown yesterday in the Strand, with Mary Pickford in the rôle of Cho Cho San. David Belasco explained at great length last week that the picture was not based on his version. The screen arrangement was taken directly from Mr. Long's book. Miss Pickford made an attractive Japanese maiden, her diminutive stature being well adapted to the character. But notwithstanding her size and her black wig, she looked more Occidental than Oriental.Another Famous Players film is ""Still Waters,"" exhibited in the Broadway Theatre. Marguerite Clark is its star, and in the rôle of a child of the circus who finally is restored to the grandfather who became estranged with his daughter when she married a circus performer she is alluring in her girlish and fragile beauty. The grandfather is a canal boat captain, whence the title. In addition to scenes along the canal there are some glimpses of circus life.One feature of the movies in their favor is their silent nature. Were they otherwise a nervous person could not patronize them, so full of shooting are they. But with the camera as a silencer one may sit and watch with immunity. In the new Triangle film, ""The Lily and the Rose,"" for instance, the husband, being disappointed, shoots himself, as movie husbands are apt to do. But so quietly does he do it, thanks to the silent cinema, that the audience doesn't realize he is dead till the Rose finds him The photography of the picture is unusually good.",article,Review,,Archives,"['MOTION PICTURES', 'Blindness of Devotion, The', 'Lily and the Rose, The', 'Madame Butterfly', 'STILL WATERS']"

4/12/1981,COMMUNITY INVOLVED IN EDUCATION OF DEAF,"WINSTED WHILE driving to Northwestern Connecticut Community College to visit his son, a deaf man was pulled over by a Winsted police officer. After gesturing that he could not hear, the driver was astounded when the officer repeated the charge - in sign language - and presented him with a speeding ticket.

That the policeman could communicate this way is not regarded as unusual by residents of this small Connecticut town near the Massachusetts border. The Chief of Police and other officers have studied sign language at the community college, as have several merchants, teachers, waitresses, bank tellers and hospital employees. 

The community's continuing interest in the education of the deaf has helped support a post-secondary school program being offered at the college. Called Career Education for the Deaf, the seven-year-old program allows hearing-impaired students to be put into regular college classes and provides them with interpreters, tutors and notetakers.",article,News,Connecticut Weekly Desk,New York,"['Deafness', 'Education and Schools', 'Colleges and Universities']"

8/9/1981,Sound; PERIL: SONIC EXCESS,"As any Puritan knows, danger lurks in our pleasures, and the trouble is that sometimes the dangers are real. After this column reported on the current popularity of lightweight earphones (June 21), we received a cautionary letter from Dr. Jane Reger Madell, warning of possible injury to the ear. The risk, Dr. Madell points out, does not lie in the use of earphones as such, but rather in listening at excessive loudness levels. Too often, it seems, earphones tempt their users to sonic excess.   Dr. Madell has done some field work on this. As a member of an institution serving people with hearing impairments, she grew concerned about the sudden proliferation of earphones used with portable sound equipment as more and more people in this city and others go about their business in a state of sonic immersion.  Equipped with a precisely calibrated sound-level meter, she stopped wired-for-sound pedestrians on the streets, asking if she might measure the loudness level of their earphones. As it turned out, a lot of ambulatory music is played at loudness levels upward of 100 decibels (db) with some as high as 120 db, which is close to the sound level of unmuffled jackhammers heard from across a street.",article,News,Arts and Leisure Desk,Arts,"['Music', 'Deafness', 'RECORDINGS AND RECORDING EQUIPMENT']"

The case is an appeal by a northern Westchester school district from a Federal appeals court decision requiring it to provide a signlanguage interpreter for a deaf third grader. The appeals court based its ruling on the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, which gives handicapped children the right to a ''free appropriate public education'' and requires school districts to prepare an ''individualized education program'' to accomplish that goal for every handicapped child.   Because the case gives the Justices their first opportunity to define what Congress meant by the word ''appropriate,'' it has considerable nationwide significance.",article,News,National Desk,U.S.,"['WESTCHESTER (NY)', 'Deafness', 'Education and Schools', 'Suits and Litigation', 'Law and Legislation', 'Handicapped']"

''We have grown to almost the same size as the center, financially,'' Mr. Hays continued, ''and although we don't anticipate severe budget cuts, we want the flexibility to face them as they come with our own board of trustees.''   ''We have been a wonderfully successful artistic theater or we wouldn't be here,'' Mr. Hays asserted. ''The exposure to fine actors in the company took the stigma out of sign language to the extent that Jane Fonda and Louise Fletcher used it in accepting their Oscars.''

''We try to encourage this,'' he explained. ''Our objective is to enable them to be as independent as possible.'' The Home for the Aged Blind was founded in the 1920's by the Jewish Guild for the Blind as a residence for blind children. As the services of the guild expanded to include social and vocational guidance, its philosophy evolved and by the late 1920's it was believed that a child's needs were best served in a home, rather than in an institutional setting.

Martin Adler, the director of an institution that he describes as ''the only national center for rehabilitation of the deaf-blind,'' said the proposal called for slashing $1.4 million from its current allocation of $3.2 million. This would mean, he said, that there would be hardly enough left to pay for salaries in a situation where the ratio of staff to clients, one-to-one plus support aides, is necessarily so high.

In an interview with Mr. Adler and Robert Smithdas, the center's deaf-blind director of community education, the director saw a glimmer of hope in a bill before Congress that would exempt the center from the across-the-board cuts in discretionary funds that most services to the handicapped are expected to suffer.

Does an ''appropriate'' education mean one that enables a child to become, as a Federal District Court posed the issue, ''a functioning member of society''? Or does it mean giving a handicapped child such as Amy, who had been performing in the top half of her class when her parents requested an interpreter, what the court called ''an opportunity to achieve his full potential''?

The principle and its corollaries are likely to be influential far beyond the world of the handicapped.   We Americans don't like the concept of rationing.

But while sound does not depend upon someone hearing it, people depend on hearing sound as an aid to survival: the honk of a horn, the ring a telephone or doorbell, the buzz of an alarm, not to mention the voices of other people, both live and electronically transmitted.   Thanks to modern technology, most of the nation's 17 million hearing-impaired individuals can now be helped to hear better through a variety of sophisticated devices, ranging from hearing aids custom-designed to the person's particular hearing problem to a still-experimental implant that can take over for the damaged cells that cause most cases of so-called nerve deafness.

11/16/1986,The Uses of Lip-Reading,"To the Editor:   I find it difficult to accept Hugh Kenner's statement in his review of ''A Loss for Words'' by Lou Ann Walker (Oct. 5) that for the deaf ''lip-reading is of little use. It relies heavily on contextual guessing, which in turn requires a good repertory of English structures.''   The great majority of the hearing cannot sign. All, however, can with a little acquaintance and practice read lips. It is true that very few of the profoundly deaf ever learn to speak well, but their lip movements grant visual access to those who make even the slightest effort to communicate with them. Those who are deaf and have been taught lip-reading have little fear of approaching anyone who has the patience to understand what they are saying. Further, it has been my experience that syntax is no problem: the deaf read and write as well as those who hear; they fully enjoy subtitled films and television programs that are captioned. Lip-reading ''socializes'' them.",article,Letter,Book Review Desk,Books,"['Walker, Lou Ann', 'Miller, Nolan', 'Kenner, Hugh', 'BOOK REVIEWS', 'Deafness', 'LIP READING', 'LOSS FOR WORDS', 'A (BOOK)']"

In New York, a group of officials in education and criminal justice - including a judge and prosecutor who themselves have learning disabilities - are taking the first steps toward changing that pattern, by changing the attitude of the courts.

In fact, the love story about a deaf woman's struggle to communicate with a hearing man has been the subject of debate in the deaf community since the film's release last month.

11/19/1986,PERSONAL HEALTH,"A TRAGEDY of modern medical care is that, even in an age of virtually instant communication, it often takes years to get the word out about new life- and limb-saving treatments to the people who could most benefit from them. One of these is laser therapy for an insidious disorder called diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of new cases of blindness among American adults. Some 600,000 people already have early stages of this condition and could lose their sight if it is not detected and promptly treated.   Each year, diabetic retinopathy renders some 5,000 diabetics legally blind, at least half of them unnecessarily. When the disorder is diagnosed early and treated with laser therapy, useful vision can often be preserved.   Yet a study in Wisconsin two years ago found that 62 percent of diabetics never had the eye examination necessary to detect retinopathy. In 1979, two years after the benefits of laser therapy were clearly demonstrated in a well-publicized national study, two-thirds of family physicians and half of internists surveyed in Michigan were unaware of the study and its implications for the prevention of blindness in diabetics.",article,Series,Living Desk,Home & Garden,"['Surveys and Series', 'Diabetes', 'Blindness', 'Eyes and Eyesight', 'PERSONAL HEALTH (TIMES COLUMN)']"

12/7/1986,"NEW JERSEY OPINION;
Labels Should Not Be Required For Special Reading","LARGE numbers of parents of handicapped children in New Jersey are voicing deep outrage over the proposal of the state's Department of Education to revise the state's system of special education.

The volatile nature of their concern is fueled by fears that services to their children will be eliminated or diluted and that critical gains that have taken so long to achieve will be lost.

The issues involved are receiving national attention and may well influence future policy for handicapped children throughout the country.

The state's plan is so sweeping that it cannot adequately be discussed in one brief article; we therefore are limiting our focus to the examination of some of the more important changes.

One proposal would ''reduce the number of pupils who must be labeled 'handicapped' in order to receive state-funded remedial programs by providing them with appropriate assistance through the general or regular educational programs offered by local school districts.''",article,Op-Ed,New Jersey Weekly Desk,New York,"['New Jersey', 'MARGOLIS, HOWARD', 'Shapiro, Arthur', 'Education and Schools', 'Standards and Standardization', 'Law and Legislation', 'Reform and Reorganization', 'Special Education (Handicapped)', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Handicapped']"

''The emphasis has been on the younger kids,'' Mrs. Miller said, ''but now those youngsters are growing up and there is a need to tell them of the many options available to them.''

Alexandra, who is hearing impaired and lip-reads with the assistance of hearing aids, was meeting one recent morning with a group of students at the New York School for the Deaf, in White Plains.

The meeting was in preparation for the students' trip to see a school performance of the ballet, which is being presented by the Westchester County Historical Society at the Academic Arts Theater of Westchester Community College from Tuesday through Thursday, with two public performances on Saturday.

Alexandra's visit with about 45 students in grades five through eight came about as the result of talks between Madeline Reich, chairman of enrichment at the School for the Deaf, and Kathy Grantham, a member of the historical society's executive board and chairman for the ballet, which reflects Colonial history.

''We wanted to take our students to see 'A Colonial Nutcracker,' '' Mrs. Reich said. ''We contacted the dance company and they told us that Alexandra is a hearing-impaired teen-ager. When I spoke with Kathy Grantham I said how wonderful it would be if we could get Alexandra to come to our school because she shares a lot of the same experiences that our students share.''",article,News,Westchester Weekly Desk,New York,"['NEW YORK SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF', 'HISTORICAL SOCIETY, WESTCHESTER COUNTY', 'SILVERMAN, ANN B', 'Deafness', 'Dancing', 'Culture', 'NUTCRACKER, THE (BALLET)']"

11/11/1990,Responding on the Learning Disabled,"The article is unfortunately typical of journalistic naivete (blindness?) in catering to the educational establishment party line about treatment of kids who aren't learning as fast as their peers. The entire focus of the article assumes that all problems reside in the child.    The teaching-learning dialogue is a two-way street -- an interaction between the professional (the school) and the client (the student). Acting as the professional, the school is supposed to manage (the key word) its end of the dialogue, such that learning occurs in the client.    If the dialogue has somehow broken down (learning has not occurred), should not any worthwhile investigation look in both directions, evaluating not only the degree of fault in the client, but also the degree of contributory imperfection on the part of the professional?    But the standard procedure is quite one-sided: A procedure is set in motion to attempt to ""identify"" a ""disability"" in the student so that he can be ""classified."" The practice rests on two important hypotheses:   1) That valid methods exist for diagnosing ""learning disabilities.""    2) That for children who cannot be shown to have an identifiable learning handicap, regular classes, methods, curricula, etc., constitute an acceptable quality of ""appropriate instruction.'   Over the past 15 years, the establishment sold, and the public bought, both hypotheses. But, should either (or both) prove to be not valid, the procedures based thereon could prove quite bizarre and maladaptive in our nation's efforts to educate its children.    It needs to be asked whether appropriate placements were made and appropriate instruction supplied in the light of the client's previous responses. (If he had been given second-grade work to do when he obviously had not mastered first grade, then the system subjected him to treatment that failed the criterion of appropriate instruction.)   The fact that parents generally tolerate a one-sided investigation suggests that they have bought not only hypotheses 1 and 2, but also a third, that the school system functions as the ideal implementer of the first two hypotheses and can do no wrong.   As the investigation proceeds and if the testing shows he has something called a learning disability, he is entitled to ""appropriate instruction in the least restrictive environment."" If it's his fault, he gets benefits of special attention. But, if the tests come up negative, that there's no fault in the student, he gets no special classes or consideration of appropriateness. This is bizarre. What kind of fair play is this?    If the cause of even some of the problem is poor teaching methods, and the remedy for all of it is good teaching, then we need to be spending (at least) equal time testing school systems for ""teaching disabilities.""

11/11/1990,Computer Aids for Visually Impaired,"A TECHNOLOGY center has opened at the Westchester Lighthouse in White Plains. The center, one of eight in the state, features adaptive equipment that makes computers accessible to the blind or visually impaired.

Clients, who range in age from college students to the elderly, are evaluated at the center by George Ashiotis, the instructor. Mr. Ashiotis, who is legally blind, helps determine what equipment is needed and orders it. He then trains the client, who may take the equipment to his or her home or office after the lessons. Financing is from the State Commission for the Blind, and a grant from the State Legislature.

The technology ""falls into three main categories,"" Mr. Ashiotis explained: screen enlargement, synthetic speech and Braille output. Some people use one kind only, others find a combination more helpful.
The New Technology 

 In screen enlargement, letters may appear ""many times their normal size,"" Mr. Ashiotis said. Additionally, certain devices enable conversion from white print on a black screen to black print on a white screen, easier to read for the visually impaired. Others enable the user to read very large print one line at a time.

Speech synthesizers ""interpret software"" and, instead of converting it to print, synthesize it into spoken words that come through a headset. Quality ranges from ""stilted to almost human,"" depending on price, Mr. Ashiotis said.

In Braille output, a printer produces Braille characters either on a strip of paper.
Who Has Been Helped 

 Clients so far have included a woman in her 30's who is now able to be a ""vital force"" in her husband's landscaping business, working in billing and bookkeeping, Mr. Ashiotis reported; a 78-year-old woman who is losing her sight but who is now able to complete a book on the restoration of old buildings; and an accounting supervisor in a large corporation who is working with complex accounting systems.

The center, Mr. Ashiotis said, helps blind and visually impaired people lead productive, rewarding professional lives. ""It helps them not only to get jobs but, in the case of someone who is losing their vision, to keep the jobs they have."" 

Judith Millman, assistant director of the Westchester Lighthouse, added: ""This broadens the scope of our services. We feel it is vitally important to give people the tools they need to be competitive in the labor market.""",article,News,Westchester Weekly Desk,New York,"['Westchester County (NY)', 'LIGHTHOUSE (NY ASSN FOR THE BLIND)', 'Ames, Lynne', 'Blindness', 'DATA PROCESSING (COMPUTERS)', 'SOFTWARE PRODUCTS']"
11/11/1990,Responding on the Learning Disabled,"The article ""The Learning Disabled: Challenge to Identify""  [ Oct. 7 ]  points out the need for independent, comprehensive evaluation of children who pose problems to the school. This is especially true in the Riverhead district, where the Superintendent's wishes are expected to be exactly affected by clinical as well as all other staff.   Identification and special education work well when aimed at improving learning. The entire district becomes handicapped, however, when special education is used to segregate the poor and minority and transient child from the mainstream.    Too many poor, minority and transient students stay too long in special-education classes with curricula too narrow and abbreviated to prepare them for ever entering the mainstream. When pressure is exerted on special-education teachers to keep their students out of the way, discipline can override learning as a goal.   Sitting still can become an academic achievement. Special education then becomes one of the subtle subconscious ways a school perpetuates the development of underclass.    Schools have dysfunctions, too. Assessment teams often have the narrowest view of ""developmental norms."" These correlate with Fischer-Price educational toys and nursery-school training.    Poor children who pose problems to the school often do not pose real developmental problems at all. Unable to ""skip to my Lou,"" they may dance with perfect coordination to complicated rhythms, recite from memory several rap lyrics, count change and estimate costs. When appreciated and enjoyed, such children want to learn.

11/11/1990,Responding on the Learning Disabled,"I am a parent of a dyslexic child. If the New York State Department of Education had its way, he certainly would have been labeled as ""learning disabled."" Over the years I have grown to hate that term.   The term ""learning disabled"" has no meaning. It was created as an umbrella term by the Federal Government in the mid-1970's. It was put into Federal law as a guideline to work with a broad array of neurologically impaired individuals, including dyslexics, aphasics, brain damaged and others.    Since the inception of this Federal law, many have tried to get proper services, educationally and otherwise, for the learning-disabled children. Primarily because educators and psychologists have had so little understanding of what learning disability actually is, and how to remediate it, children with learning disabilities suffered from too little or inadequate services.   Contrary to what the article states, individuals, must, as one of the criteria, possess an average or above-average I.Q. to be classified as learning disabled.   Many parents fought the New York State Department of Education to try and make state education law more specific in defining what constitutes learning disability, so that this population would not slip through the cracks of the educational system. The educational system would hand a diploma to a person who is ready to graduate from high school but unable to read or write. State Education watered down special-education law for this population year after year.   Some of us just became sick and tired of fighting the system, from the classroom teacher right on up to the New York State Commissioner of Education. If I had not transferred my son from a public school system (after completion of eighth grade, actually reading many grade levels lower), to a private school, one that was well equipped to educate dyslexic children, I seriously doubt that he would be in a graduate program at New York University today.   Sad to say, college-level special- and regular-education programs could strengthen their curriculum in the area of learning disabilities. Then teachers and other personnel would be better prepared to recognize this population as soon as academic failure begins. The emotional problems begin because of the level of frustration these children experience when they know that they can't keep up academically with their peers.   Learning disability is truly a silent killer. Not in the physical sense, but certainly in school success, ambition, self-esteem and other areas that reflect good performance in the academic arena.

12/9/1990,Learning Disabled Are Like 'Normal' Students,"As a teacher of learning-disabled students and parent of a learning-disabled child, I believe that the letter  [ Nov. 11 ]  from H. Blau, a retired educator of learning-disabled children, was a disservice to parents, professionals and, most of all, to learning-disabled students.   How does she explain that the fifth of my six children is learning disabled? Why was our recent College Fair for Learning Disabled Students and their parents held in West Babylon Senior High School such a huge success? Learning-disabled students are very much like ""normal"" students. Some are motivated and some are lazy. Many have supportive families and many come from dysfunctional families. Whle behavior for some is excellent, others exhibit inappropriate behavior. The difference is in how they learn.   Research shows that learning disabilities are caused by a dysfunction in a specific part of the brain. It is now recognized by medical experts that learning disabilities are neurologically based, and not caused by environmental factors.   Years ago it was believed that autistic children came from uncaring and unresponsive parents. Now it is known that this disorder is neuroligically based, as are learning disabilities. There are many factors that can cause a child to be a low achiever; learning disabilities can be one of them. However, it is important to differentiate among these many factors and not to inaccurately label learning-disabled students and their families. RUTH M.

It is no surprise to me to read of the tremendous interest hearing young people have in learning sign language. Six years ago, at the request of the children's librarian at the Mamaroneck Free Library, I began teaching a summer workshop in sign language for children ages 8 to 12 that has been repeated every summer since then. We require pre-registration and put a limit of 14 children on the class.   There are always many children on the waiting list and often adults want to join the class. Motivation is high, homework considerable as I give the children many pages of pictured signs each week, together with directions as to how to make the signs, and the origin of the signs. Children will take the pages home to share with parents, siblings, family and friends.   As a retired teacher of deaf children it gives me great pleasure to help bridge the gap between the deaf and the hearing in this manner and in this Westchester section of our world.

Indeed, Linda Delpenha, chairwoman of a committee on drug-exposed children, reports that while teachers can identify troubled children after extensive interviews, ""the problems in many cases were traced not to drug exposure but to some other traumatic event -- a death in the family, homelessness.""   As sociologists (funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse) researching crack-using women, we call your attention to an insidious problem that results from news stories of this kind. Women who use crack while pregnant believe their unborn children are hopelessly damaged. Their guilt and shame lead many to continue using. If headlines, rather than a few lines at the end of an article, stated that the effects of crack could be reduced, perhaps these women would be inspired to stop using the drug.   Furthermore, by your focusing on crack, rather than the lack of education, of access to health care, of safe housing and of basic nutrition, the effect is to blame individual mothers, rather than the conditions of poverty, for the problems of the children. Before we label a generation of inner-city kindergartners as crack babies, many of whom have never been exposed to crack, perhaps we ought to call them what they truly are -- poverty babies.

Therefore their promotion of the sole use of Braille, which is an antiquated form of communication and which tends to insulate blind people rather than assimilate them into society.   It is paradoxical that the Disabilities Act, which was meant to equalize disabled persons with the rest of society, is now being used to vitiate its initial purpose by the reintroduction of Braille into curriculums. If in fact blind people do want to learn Braille, it should be an option. It is not their sole means to literacy.

2/18/1992,Deafness Gene,"Scientists say they have identified a gene that can cause deafness in children, a step that may help in diagnosis and in finding a treatment.   Two independent teams of scientists have reported finding the gene that when defective causes a disorder called Waardenburg's syndrome.   The inherited syndrome is responsible for 3 percent of childhood deafness, said Dr. Aubrey Milunsky, an author of one of the reports. People with the syndrome often have a distinctive appearance that can include a shock of white hair, wide spacing of the eyes or one eye a different color from the other.   Only about 20 percent of patients have total hearing loss, Dr. Milunsky said. But anybody with the defective gene has a 50 percent chance of transmitting it to his or her child, in whom it may produce deafness, he said.   Dr. David Edelstein of the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital, who was not connected with the study, said the finding might aid in diagnosis and point the way to a treatment.   The finding of the gene is reported in the current issue of the journal Nature. Researchers studied families with a history of the disease, and found that mutations in the gene were associated with appearance of the syndrome.   One team included Dr. Milunsky and colleagues at the Boston University School of Medicine and Elias da Silva at the Federal University of Puernambuco in Brazil.

Otherwise, the opposition of many deaf people to an operation that can sometimes restore hearing seems, at best, odd or idiosyncratic. At worst, especially in the case of denying the operation to a child, it seems cruel.   In my research for a book on the history of the disability rights movement, I found that fear of the cochlear implant comes out of the deaf community's well-founded sense of oppression. It is a reaction to more than a century of belief that deafness is a sickness, to be pitied, cured and eradicated.

The first rehearsals of the adult chorus, last Tuesday at the Manhattan Center in midtown, struck an observer who has always admired Mr. Shaw's results as oddly mechanistic affairs.

This is the Reece School, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, for children in grades K to 6 with developmental disorders. It is a place for youngsters whose severe learning disabilities and emotional problems have threatened to cut them off from the world. But for a remarkably high percentage, the school is also an opportunity to rejoin it. Impaired Abilities    Most of the Reece students suffer from attention-deficit disorder, which is often associated with hyperactivity and impulsive behavior, or pervasive developmental disorder. Pervasive developmental disorder is the more serious, impairing a child's ability to develop cognitive, language, motor, social or imagination skills. Children with this disorder are often withdrawn and hypersensitive to sound and light.",article,News,Education Life Supplement,Education,"['REECE SCHOOL', 'Learning Disabilities', 'Education and Schools', 'Mental Health and Disorders', 'SPECIAL SECTIONS', 'Special Education (Handicapped)']"
